    "text": "Map of absolute turnout and turnout relative to projected turnout through DATE WILL GO HERE.\nRight now data uses the primary election as a placeholder. Beginning two weeks from election day, this can get updated daily with live data. Importantly, some of th areas of lowest primary turnout (e.g., Rainier Valley) also exceeded expectations (relative to expected general election turnout) more than any other area. Model-based predictions of turnout may struggle to capture the current (national) political environment and a more energized voting population. Primary turnout may be a useful metric to compare to, in additional to model-based predictions."
